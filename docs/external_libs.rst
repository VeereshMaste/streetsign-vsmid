External Libraries
==================

TODO (much more detail, and author/licence info)

None of this would be even remotely possible without the amazing open source
community, and the following fantastic libraries that I've been able to use:

`Flask`_
--------


`Flask`_ is cool
Python (Micro) web framework

`Peewee`_
---------

Simple, splendid Python ORM

`Flask-Peewee`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Joining flask and peewee together with ease

`Sqlite`_
---------

Simple, Fast single-file database system.

`jQuery`_
---------

Better DOM for javascript in the browser

Also these jQuery plugins:

`jQuery.transit`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use CSS transitions for faster smoother animation.

`chosen`_
~~~~~~~~~

Very sweet multiselect boxes.

`knockout.js`_
--------------

For doing interactive object modelling and user-interface stuff which would
be horrible in javascript + html otherwise.

knockout.mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Which turns non-schema/undefined messy JSON objects into knockout object arrays
which can be assigned, modified, and played with.

Twitter `Bootstrap`_
--------------------

I'm not a front-end CSS wizard, and this helps the admin interface look clean and
professional with so little work from me.  It really does wonders.

bootstrap-wysihtml5 & wysihtml5
-------------------------------

Very nice, simple HTML5 rich text editor, with bootstrap integration

bootstrap-datetimepicker
------------------------

Nice looking reasonably easy to use date & time picker controls.  Really, browsers
should have this stuff built-in already.

`Pylint`_
---------

For making it so much easier to keep the code base consistent and clean.

pylint git commit hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
forcing me to keep it clean.

`Bleach`_
---------
Stripping and cleaning HTML is so easy with this great library!

`FeedParser`_
-------------

Parsing XML (RSS & Atom) feeds has never been so easy!

Passlib & py-bcrypt
-------------------

There is no reason to keep passwords insecurely...

`Waitress`_
-----------

The simplest WSGI server ever...
